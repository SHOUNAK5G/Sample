        <p> Must watch for adults and teenagers

          Its such an eye opener. P.V Narasimha Rao was involved in many crimes..be it Harshad Mehta scam or Havala cheating case or even behelding Nambi in jail etc etc lot of evidences available in market to research on him
          Congress was the biggest scammer n cheater out there back in those times when they were rulingâ€¦Coming to the movie..very gripping Madhavanâ€™s acting in first half is very positive and solid later on when things change it goes dull but still watchable giving full rating because everyone must watch what happens in our country politically One thing you realise after watching the movie is that Nambi Narayanan is equally respectable as Abdul Kalam ji but no one knew him before this film. Not only Nambi sir many of our great scientists didn't accept NASA's job ..the best example is Kalam Sir. This movie should be watched by everyone. Just like Narayan sir never got the position and respect he deserved, R Madhavan being an extremely talented actor, didn't get that much from bollywood and audience which he deserved good to see that south industry is giving justice to his talent Most Important thing With minimal technical terms, Madhavan makes 'Rocketry' movie intense and totally engaging and doesn't show Nambi as God but keeps things authentic. And of course Thanks to srk and surya for working for no money and giving great performance in the movie. R madhavan should get national award such an impactful performance. May no one be so much cruel to such a gem person who has sacrificed his life for humanity and didn't expect anything for his personal purpose. Please don't give this type treatment to this kind people. Seriously everyone should watch this movie and know who is the respected genius Nambi Narayan is. Please everyone go to the theatre and make this type of content hit. So that in future we will see this type of content and effort more and more. Rocketry perhaps after a very long time we got to see a real content movie which had no nonsense scenes cheap dialogues songs just a pure movie with refreshing story and message for today youngsters who hardly know about these issues

        <p> Dhamaal is an amazing and very funny story of four ordinary university dropouts and unemployed men formed their own group of con artists, carrying out theft and other illegal activities to get money. It's truly crazy and a laughing riot. With Director Indra Kumar weaving in new characters, unexpected plots and twists and turns, making it truly come ducal and putting a smile on the faces of the audience although some parts including the plot of the film are based on Rat Race, It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World and Mr. Bean (the British TV Series and it's feature film in 1997). However, the ending of the film where the 6 men arrive at a Help Orphan Children Organization charity, the comedy is drained out but Director Kumar manages to refill the gaps with comedy when Kabir is interrogated by his boss again and the end song and dance as the credits roll. Watch this if you are feeling lonely, bored or down. As the name suggests, the film does do it's best to make you laugh. It did truly tickle my funny bone and drew a smile on me several times. Basically, this is what a comedy/drama film is meant to be! Arshad, Aashish, Ritesh and Javed truly shine as these four lovable and funny idiots with Sanjay Dutt and Asrani doing a spectacular performance, playing tough and strict but still funny men.
